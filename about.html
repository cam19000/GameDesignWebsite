<h1>About Us</h1>

</body>

<p>
    My name is Cameron, I am a Computer Science student at University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
    I created this website as a project for my Web Development class.
    The purpose of this assignment was to get a “client” that tells you what they want you to design for them.
    In this case, my client asked me to design a website that would teach him about the fundamentals of coding in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
    This website should also provide him with different resources to continue learning on his own since this is a very basic explanation of the 3 languages.
    This is the first website that I have created, and I hope that I can continue to improve with the functionality, and aesthetics of web development.
