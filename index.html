<h1>Website Game Development Made Easy!</h1>

    <p>Hello! If you have stumbled upon this website, it means that you are most likely interested in learning how to build a website, or a JavaScript game.
        Well if that is the case, you’ve come to the right place!
        This website will teach you the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and even include an example game on this site.
        Before you get started on your web development journey, you need to know what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are.

<h2>Html</h2>


<p>
    HTML is a markup language, meaning that it uses tags to define elements within a document.
    This just means that it uses keywords to allow information to be easily accessible to both users, and coders. HTML elements are represented by tags: “<>.”
    Each element must have both a closing tag, and a starting tag. For example, if a web developer wanted to create a paragraph, they could use “< p > random text < /p >.”
    HTML also uses classes to define certain areas of code that a developer would like to access from another language such as CSS.
    For example, if a developer wanted to change certain aspects of a SINGLE image, they could define that image under a certain class which would allow them to change properties of just that image.
    I wrote out some example code below to demonstrate how to define an image with a certain class.
