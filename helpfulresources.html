    This page contains many helpful resources that can help new web developers continue learning.
    (KEEP IN MIND, ALL IMAGES ON THIS PAGE ARE CLICKABLE AND WILL REDIRECT YOU TO THE OFFICIAL SITE FOR EACH OF THE LISTED RESOURCES.)
    The first website that Iâ€™d like to introduce is Codecademy.
    Codecademy is a great website to learn new concepts because it is interactive and allows a student to code directly on their platform.
    They have a wide variety of courses, but for learning web development, I have linked their HTML & CSS course.
    Codecademy was founded by Zach Sims and Ryan Bubinski in 2011 as a way to teach both children, and adults the fundamentals of coding in many different languages.
    While this is an amazing website to learn, some of the most useful lessons on the site are "pro" courses.
    Pro membership costs 19.99 a month which might be a lot of money to many students.
    This next website however, is completely free and relies on other users to provide content.

    <h3><a href="#tabs-2">Stack Overflow</a></h3>
        <div id="tabs-2">

    <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/"><img alt="stack overflow" src="https://webpages.uncc.edu/ccross21/Website/Images/stack.png" class = "languagelogos"></a>
<p>
    Stack overflow is a phenomenal website for problem solving issues.
    This website allows users to post their code, along with a question about how to make something work, optimize something, or any other question that they have.
    When a coder is problem solving their own issue, they can always search for it on stack overflow because if a coder has that problem, someone else most likely did as well.
    While this issue is amazing for solving problems, it does come with it's drawbacks.
    The reason this website isn't the best for LEARNING is because the explanation's posted on their are usually fairly difficult to understand for the beginner coder.
    When a user finds their problem on stack overflow, they can also search for it on the next website on this list.

        <h3><a href="#tabs-3">YouTube</a></h3>
            <div id="tabs-3">
<a href = "https://youtube.com"><img alt="youtube" src="https://webpages.uncc.edu/ccross21/Website/Images/youtube.png" class = "languagelogos"></a>

<p>
    YouTube is an amazing website for learning through videos if you learn better that way.
    There is a massive amount of free content on here that will allow developers to learn new concepts and strengthen the concepts they already know.
    The biggest problem with YouTube is that many of the videos contain poor quality information, and a user will have to sift through this to find the quality content.
    One of the best ways to learn a new language is to follow a course on YouTube. Many creators on YouTube will post videos courses in order, via playlist which allow a user to follow step by step through the process of learning a new programming language.
